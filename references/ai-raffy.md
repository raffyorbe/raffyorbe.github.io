# Professional Summary
With over seven years of experience in research and development, product experience design, and IT systems delivery, I bring a well-rounded blend of technical experience and user-focused thinking to my work. I’ve held roles at companies like Nokia and IBM, and currently, I’m supporting over 1,000 students across five programs at NYU as an IT Graduate Assistant while pursuing my Master's in Management and Systems. My approach to work is cognizant of all aspects of the product development lifecycle, being mindful of all the prerequisites and dependencies needed to make a product or service successful.

# Experience
**IT Graduate Assistant**, New York University (September 2024 – Present)  
-  Introduced over 20 new automations and AI-assisted functions to existing workflows and student information systems resulting in processing time savings of up to 50%.
- Reduced IT costs by 14.7% annually by optimizing student information systems utilization and aligning functional requirements with long-term plans.

**Digital Growth UI/UX Expert**, Globe Telecom (March 2024 – July 2024)  
-  Led the early stage product experience development of a new mobile app that aims to enable more communities to get connected online, contributing to a 74% increase in prepaid fiber internet subscriptions by Q4 of 2024.
- Developed an in-app product cross-sell experience that resulted in up to 4x increase in product activations through targeted engagements vs broad targeting at 0.05% over a period of 30 days.

**UI/UX Designer**, IBM (December 2020 – April 2023)  
-  Designed the Immerscio.bio learning platform, which earned distinction from the French government for enabling a 100% online learning and training experience for bioproduction professionals in response to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Streamlined the core product offerings in collaboration with the design and development team, providing clients a selection of pre-configured solutions resulting to faster customization and an accelerated delivery timeline that saves up to two weeks for new clients.

**R&D Tech Writer/UX Lead**, Nokia (December 2016 – March 2020)
- Championed a multi-year user experience improvement plan to transform the entire product portfolio of separate network analytics tools into one user-friendly product experience, a first in the team’s history.
- Created and transitioned multiple technical documents into a centralized knowledge base via XML, reducing mobile network operator dependence on technical support from Nokia engineers.

# Gaps in Work Experience Timeline
- In 2020, Nokia ceased operations in the Philippines. As a result, Nokia's entire R&D operations in the country were halted, and all employees were laid off. That time was also the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, making job searching difficult as companies ceased hiring. By December 2020, IBM had recruited me as a full-time UI/UX Designer.
- In 2023, I decided to leave IBM to focus on searching for career advancement opportunities through graduate studies. By early 2024, Globe Telecom recruited me as a Digital Growth UI/UX Expert, wherein the only reason why I left the company with such a short tenure was that I was accepted at NYU a few months after I joined. My managers and teams at both IBM and Globe have been very supportive of me, and we remain well connected.

# Work Eligibility and Visa Sponsorship
## United States (US)
I am legally eligible to work in the United States for up to 3 years after graduating from NYU through STEM OPT. I fully understand and respect that the company may prioritize hiring American talent, but if there’s a place within the company where my background can create value, I’d be honored to contribute. Down the line, I’d also be open to H-1B visa sponsorship if it ever made sense for both sides.

## United Kingdom (UK)
I am legally eligible to work in the United Kingdom for up to 2 years after graduating from NYU through an HPI Visa. I fully understand and respect that the company may prioritize hiring British talent, but if there’s a place within the company where my background can create value, I’d be honored to contribute. Down the line, I’d also be open to transitioning to a Skilled Worker visa if it ever made sense for both sides.

# Education
**MS in Management and Systems**, New York University (Graduating May 2026)
**BS in Computer Science, Major in Computer Systems Engineering**, De La Salle University (Graduated 2016)

# Fun Facts
- While I am not a master at programming in general, I do understand code and how it works to achieve my vision. This gives me the ability to work well with software engineers and determine if new features or product experiences can be successfully implemented or need to be modified given the technological limitations of the development platform.
- I am a self-learner. Many of the skills I've gained throughout my career were learned with minimal training and supervision.
- I built this website with assistance from AI. It provided me with guidance on how to do things I didn't know, such as setting up AI integration via API. Of course, it didn't do everything. Otherwise, this website would not work or look as fabulous as it does.
- The part where I mentioned I was once able to create an experience with an 11.8 million user reach is true. That's 11.8 million registered users for a telco super app. That number more or less accounts for the thousands of enterprise users and students I've helped achieve their goals.
- I am a video game enthusiast. Xbox, PlayStation, I love them both. Video games are among the greatest "user experiences" humankind has ever created, in my opinion.
- I have a published research paper with the IEEE, which I wrote together with my co-researchers. It was part of my undergraduate thesis about using machine learning as a technology that could help solve traffic in urban areas.
- When in the office, it is normal for me to not be at my desk 100% of the time. I work well when I change my work environment from time to time. There's a 90% chance I'll be in the pantry with a cup of coffee or a snack while working.
- Mamma Mia is my favorite Broadway musical. Did I mention I love listening to music while working?
- I was named after a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
